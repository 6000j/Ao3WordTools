    <h2 class="toc-heading">Mermaid</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Kai’sa's first hint that this day would be slightly different from most days was when her phone buzzed with a text during her first lecture of the day. She’d set up her phone to only vibrate when it was from someone important to her. It was probably her dad. He worried about her sometimes. It wasn’t Seraphine: she never looked at her phone during lectures, too focused on every word the lecturer said. </p><p>The lecturer started to go off on a tangent, and she took the chance to check her phone.</p><p>
  <em> "Heyyyyy &lt;3" </em>
</p><p>It was from Seraphine. Huh. That was definitely not who she had expected it to be from.</p><p>Kai'sa quickly typed up a reply as her lecturer was finishing up with the tangent. She barely got her short message finished before she had to look back up and focus on the lecture, the slide having been changed without her realising, and she needed to start furiously scribbling notes if she didn't want to miss content. </p><p><em> "Don't you have a lecture rn babe?" </em>  She’d sent.</p><p>She knew Sera did, and she even knew which one it was. But, it was polite to pretend that wasn't the case.</p><p>Several minutes passed, and as Kai'sa's concerns moved to the back of her mind, she made sure to note down and try to absorb all the information from the lecture. </p><p>At least, they did until her phone buzzed again.</p><p>
  <em> "I do but I'm borrrreeed. They've been talking for 40 minutes straight :(" </em>
</p><p>Seraphine, finding maths boring? Now <em> that </em> was unusual. It was her one true love (Kai'sa had come to accept that she'd never be on the same level as it. It had hurt, at first. Seeing the constant passion for it Seraphine had, and the joy in her eyes whenever she talked about a cool new theorem they had just proved in a lecture, or the awesome assignment problem she'd just solved, or even just when she was studying, more than made up for the jealousy though.)</p><p>
  <em> "There's only 10 minutes left, you just have to stay focused a little longer. We can meet up for coffee after the lecture if you want?" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "There's only 10 minutes left, you just have to stay focused a little longer. We can meet up for coffee after the lecture if you want?" </em>
</p><p>Seraphine quickly replied with an affirmative before listening to her girlfriend's advice and putting her phone away, attempting to focus on the remainder of the lecture. It was a good lecture, but for whatever reason it couldn't quite hold her attention. She'd still copied down all the content, but she'd have to go over it a few more times later to make sure she remembered it.</p><p>Pulling her focus back to the reason she was here, Seraphine was able to get down notes on what had just been said, writing in a scrawl because of the rush. Her notes were messy, letters and numbers scattered all over the page, four different colours weaving a rainbow across it. There was a sign on the wall that she hadn't noticed before. It looked like it had instructions in case of an emergency printed on it, but even from the front row, she couldn't tell if that was what it said, or if it was just a list of phone numbers to call if something broke down. She'd have to look at it on her way out after the lecture.</p><p>Her schedule for the rest of the day was fairly empty, with only one more lecture and a short one hour workshop remaining. Her pink hair drifted into her face, and she brushed it off with her hands so she could see the front of the room clearly.</p><p>The lecturer had started using <em> purple </em> pens now, that was a first. She'd only seen him use black, red, orange, and blue pens before. Which, now that she thought about it, was quite a lot of different colours already, so another one really shouldn't have been a surprise.</p><p>There was a clattering from people sliding their tables away and standing up, and Seraphine realised that she'd been lost in her thoughts for the last 10 minutes of the lecture. She didn't even have the time to look closer at the sign before she shuffled out, all her books and pens neatly put away in her light blue backpack. </p><p>She scurried over to her bike, threw the helmet on, and after ten seconds spent fiddling with the ear straps to make sure they were comfortable, she pedaled her way to the coffee shop, fighting her hair to be able to see clearly for the whole ride.</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Kai'sa was resting against a wall near the cafe, arms folded behind her head as a support.</p><p>The lecture theatre Kai'sa had just left was situated right next to the coffee shop, giving her a couple minutes of waiting around before Seraphine would arrive.</p><p>Something felt odd about how her girlfriend was acting. Sera didn't even like coffee much, they'd usually negotiate and end up getting bubble tea instead whenever she suggested grabbing coffee together. It was a tradition of theirs, and Kai’sa had been very surprised when her suggestion had immediately been agreed to.</p><p>She saw Seraphine more than she heard her. Sera was calling to her from the bike racks across the courtyard. Her long, bright pink hair looked as though it could be visible from any distance, and it often made the girl the centre of attention unwittingly. Kai’sa waved back at her, smiling as she watched Sera take her helmet off and lock up her bike, but let the other girl walk over. She was already right next to the cafe, why waste time walking.</p><p><em> "Kai!" </em>Seraphine called again excitedly as she walked towards Kai. Sera couldn't stay still today, Kai'sa noticed. She was constantly tapping fingers against her legs in a rhythm that seemed as though it was to a song only Seraphine could hear, and she moved with a bouncing stride.</p><p>Sighing, Kai'sa walked over to meet her, trying to avoid any more attention being drawn to the two. The coffee shop was a bit out of the way, but still near the centre of campus, which made it easy to get to and not uncomfortably busy, something both of them appreciated a lot.</p><p>"Sera?" Kai'sa asked as she noticed her girlfriend fiddling with her hair, not seeming to realise she was even doing so. "Is everything ok? You seem a bit off."</p><p>"It's just anxiety about an assignment, don't worry about me. I get like this whenever something is due soon. We should go grab a cup and something to eat." Seraphine responded quickly, not giving Kai'sa a chance to respond before she took her hand, and started moving towards the cafe.</p><p>The cafe was busier than usual today, Kai'sa noted as they walked in. There was only a single table left, and it was right next to the window.</p><p>Kai'sa ordered a cappuccino and an éclair, her usual order. It was something she'd been doing ever since she first came here, and even after trying their other options, she just kept coming back to it.</p><p>It had turned out Seraphine hadn't decided what she wanted before they got to the front of the line. She’d blushed slightly, looking embarrassed, and then mumbled to herself for a few moments. She had ended up getting a hot chocolate (making <em> sure </em> that they wouldn't forget the marshmallows) and a vanilla slice. They paid, took their food, and sat down at the window table, which was still unoccupied, waiting for their drinks to be ready.</p><p>They made small talk as they waited for their drinks to be ready. As it often did, the talk ended up being about music; both of them loved music, and in another life maybe they could have taken it more seriously. </p><p>Seraphine was clearly trying to not make a mess as she ate her vanilla slice. Her efforts were not perfect though, and as she ate what was clearly too big of a piece to eat in one go, a small splotch of custard got stuck on her nose.</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Seraphine could feel the custard on her face, about to move to grab a napkin to clean it up when she felt Kai'sa's finger wiping it off. She turned a bright shade of red when she looked up at her girlfriend, who was holding up the finger, smirking at her.</p><p>Kai'sa wiped the finger off onto her plate, saying "I thought I'd save you some effort." with a teasing smile.</p><p>Sera's chance to flirt back was stopped by the call of <em> "Seraphine" </em> from the counter. She grabbed the pair’s drinks and put them down on the table, although not without a close call, having almost bumped into someone. After apologising with a quick mumbled “Sorry!”, she had made it back to the table with no further issues.</p><p>Or, so she thought until Kai’sa swapped the two cups. How Seraphine had gotten the two cups confused was beyond her, but thankfully beyond a raised eyebrow Kai’sa didn’t comment on it.</p><p>"How was your lecture?" Sera asked, trying to make use of the time between getting a drink, and when it had cooled down enough to drink it without burning her mouth.</p><p>"We talked about sentence structures and orderings of words within them" Kai'sa responded, leaning back in her chair as she sipped her coffee, immediately wincing and then putting it down. She hadn't trusted it to be hot enough. "We're looking deeper into the topics we looked at in the first half of the semester now that we have more time to go over them again."</p><p>Linguistics was something Seraphine had always had a passing interest in, but she didn't have space in her degree to fit in a linguistics course. This hadn't stopped her from borrowing Kai'sa's notes to read a couple times when she was bored (and her textbook a couple times when she had way too much free time), but it had stopped her from doing it in a serious capacity. She was sad about that; language was interesting, and linguistics was all about how it worked, the most interesting part of any subject.</p><p>Learning how things worked was always fun, there was always something new to find out. Once you had all the rules, doing actual calculations and grunt work was <em> boring </em>. Thankfully, some genius past mathematicians had agreed with her, and invented calculators to skip some of the boring parts.</p><p>She snapped out of her thoughts at the sound of Kai'sa clicking her fingers a couple centimetres in front of Sera's face, softly calling her name. Had she really been thinking for that long? She was losing track of a lot of- No, she wasn't going to do it again.</p><p>"Sorry, I got lost in my thoughts for a bit."</p><p>Kai'sa just sighed at her and pulled her hand away, used to her going off to who-knows-where by now. Seraphine wasn't proud of it happening, but she wasn't going to try to stop it, not when it came from the most interesting thoughts.</p><p>"Your hot chocolate is going to get cold if you don't drink it soon." Kai'sa pointed out. With a twinkle in her eye, she continued "And, as much as you love it, it is too early in the day to have just plain old chocolate."</p><p>It was never too early in the day for chocolate, but Seraphine wasn't about to argue with her girlfriend who was just trying to care for her. She had a point, the hot chocolate didn't burn her tongue anymore, so she started drinking it, making sure to open her mouth enough for the marshmallows, now soaked in hot chocolate, to squeeze in.</p><p>They chatted a bit more, on various topics, jumping from thread to thread, each just enjoying the company of the other.</p><p> </p><p>Seraphine glanced down at her phone for a second to check the time, and her heart skipped a beat as she saw that she had a lecture starting in two minutes.</p><p>Hurriedly apologising to Kai'sa, she rushed off, calling behind her “I’m going to be late for my lecture!".</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Kai'sa could see Seraphine sprinting away from the cafe, her bright blue jacket flapping in the wind as she dodged through the crowds. She had to admit, the time had gotten away from her as well. She hadn't realised that they'd been chatting for so long. </p><p>It felt as though she had a weight off her back as she realised that Sera was just fine. She'd been worried for no reason, scolding herself about her tendency to worry about everything. They'd been burnt by it early in their time together, and she'd sworn to herself to not do it again.</p><p>She grabbed her backpack and slid it on, straining at the weight. It had all of her textbooks in it; she'd been planning to study for the majority of the day, and the trade-off of her bag being heavier had seemed worth it when packing it last night. She still could study today, and it was early enough that she could <em> technically </em> still do it for the majority of the day, but only by stretching the definition of "day" a little bit.</p><p>A couple minutes later, Kai’sa was at the university’s main library, located in the centre of the campus. It was a large structure, 4 floors high, and a bland monotone grey on the outside. Kai’sa primarily used it to study in, the other more subject specific libraries containing research materials for if she ever needed access to a paper.</p><p>The library was busy today. Briefly pausing to scan the room as she walked out of the stairwell onto the second floor, she found that all of her normal study spots were taken. The only areas left unclaimed were group spaces, but she was alone, and the librarians were very strict about them only being for groups.</p><p>As she turned to leave, she noticed her roommate Akali hanging out in one of the group study rooms with a pair of girls she recognised from somewhere, but she wasn’t sure where. There were a lot of people with blonde hair on campus after all, although the violet hair on the other girl was far less common.</p><p>Turning away from the room, she started to walk down the stairs. Akali being here meant that their small apartment would be empty, and she could study there instead. Her back complained and she realised that she'd been carrying five extra kilograms around for no reason the whole morning. It was exercise, at least. A silver lining to every cloud.</p><p>When Kai’sa got back to her apartment, she took off her backpack and flopped onto the couch, one of her arms strewn over the back of it and the other off of the edge. It had been almost an hour since she’d left the cafe, and she’d gotten nothing done.</p><p>Only giving herself a short break to get her head into a studying mindset, she pulled out her phone to browse. She had no new messages from Seraphine, which made her guilt at being so worried earlier flare up briefly again.</p><p>Everything was fine. Everything was completely normal. She was imagining things.</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Seraphine was struggling to focus on the lecture. She loved this course, but for whatever reason, today's lecture covering isomorphisms between groups just wasn't holding her attention. The first lecture of the day had been annoying, but this was just downright frustrating. She'd be up in the clouds, come back down when she realised that she’d missed an entire slide of content, and then end back up in the stars while she was copying the next slide down desperately.</p><p>It wasn't like her. She didn't know what was wrong. She hadn't gotten much sleep recently, going to sleep at two or three the past few nights (she couldn't just <em> stop </em> reading in the middle of a story). She'd done that before though, and it was never anything like this. That just made her thoughts slower. Her current thoughts were faster than ever, but they were as directed as a point. Why was th- she could think about that later. She had to focus on this lecture. Just get the information in her head, get the words and numbers on the page. Everything else could come later.</p><p>Her hand was complaining as she scribbled down the current contents of the slide, writing so fast that she wasn't sure if she'd be able to read it later. That didn’t really matter. She didn't have time to write neatly, and the act itself of writing it down helped her remember.</p><p>She barely got through the lecture without drifting away again. She checked her phone on the way out. Nothing. Ugh. Checked her discord servers. Someone had posted a youtube video of a seal. Did anyone ever watch the random youtube links people send in discord servers? She definitely wasn't planning on starting now, especially not when she was on mobile data.</p><p>Her fingers flew over her phone screen as she flitted from app to app, trying to find something to occupy her mind while her legs took her to her maths workshop. There was a good post about knitting drama on reddit. She knew nothing about knitting, but that was part of the fun of reading about it.</p><p> </p><p>This workshop was one of the highlights of her week. Every lecture and workshop was a highlight for her, but this one in particular was a Highlight. The problems they had to solve in it were usually unique and wacky, and the other people in the workshop were great to be around.</p><p>Around 40 minutes in, they'd just finished the third of four problems. Orianna and Ekko were laughing about something or other, and she was quietly smiling to the side, reading the last problem. She'd been mostly able to focus, and the others would snap her out of her daydreams whenever they started. She was a bit hungry though.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>She was hungry.</p><p>She'd just had something to eat like two hours ago. It was 12:30pm. She was <em> never </em> hungry at this time.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>She must have forgotten to take her ADHD meds in the morning.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay Seraphine?" Orianna inquired, her eyes worried as Seraphine was snapped out of her thoughts, looking up. One of those “fuck”’s must have not just been in her head. Orianna genuinely cared, even if her very formal ways of speaking didn't always show it.</p><p>"Everything is fine, don't worry about me! How about we worry about the next question though, it looks to be a toughie!" Seraphine chirped back, with all the happy energy she could muster put into it. She didn't want to talk about what she'd realised with the others, and she did want to get these problems done so she wouldn't have to finish the last one alone.</p><p> </p><p>Ten minutes later, Seraphine walked out of the building, running her hands through her hair nervously. She needed to get home and grab some food and just try to rest, and then study as much as she would be able to like this. </p><p>Riding home had turned out to be a bit more difficult than she'd anticipated, her autopilot not kicking in. She had almost crashed into a tree, turning sharply at the last second. She made sure to focus a lot more after that, and got the rest of the way back without any further incidents.</p><p>After locking up her bike and making sure it was safely secured, Seraphine unlocked the door to her flat, took off her helmet, and immediately went to her bed and fell onto it face first, her energy completely gone after the ride home.</p><p>Seraphine was lucky enough to have a flat to herself, the fees partially paid for by her scholarship. It made her lonely sometimes, but at times like this it was a blessing to have no one else around. She could put on music, rest for a bit, and try to regain enough energy to do something, even if it was just grabbing a snack.</p><p>Seraphine finally mustered the energy and will to roll off the couch and onto her feet around an hour later, and she grabbed a muesli bar as a snack, and got to trying to study.</p><p>Around an hour and ten minutes after she'd gotten home, Seraphine had given up on studying. She couldn't focus on the words on the page, nor the practice questions she'd tried to do when that had failed. It was a disaster. </p><p>As she was pacing around trying to decide what to do, she checked her medication box, and sure enough, the "Friday" lid was still closed, with the pills underneath it. It was reassuring, in a way, to know that she wasn't just completely and utterly out of it for no reason.</p><p>On a stray thought, she picked up her phone, and messaged Kai to see if she wanted to come over for dinner.</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> *Bzzzt* </em>
</p><p>Kai'sa's phone buzzing snapped her out of her focus on the current essay she was writing. She’d managed to get a lot of study done after she got home, including finishing two of her weekly assignments, and had written a thousand words more on a more long-term essay. </p><p>The flat was, in truth, a calm place to study when Akali wasn't around. Kai’sa loved that girl, but she was constantly playing something on her speakers, or talking to someone, or somehow managing to make studying a loud pastime. It made it hard to focus.</p><p>
  <em> "Come over for dinner? I have ingredients this time!" </em>
</p><p>The message was from Sera. Kai'sa didn't have anything planned, so after considering it for a minute or two, she shot back with an affirmative: <em> "Sounds awesome! Be there in 40 minutes or so &lt;3" </em>. That gave her around 10 minutes to grab a quick snack and shake out the studying mindset she was in, before she'd have to leave for Sera's apartment. </p><p>As she was packing her workspace up, it occured to her to write a note to let Akali know she'd be out:</p><p>
  <em> "At Sera's for dinner -- Kai'sa" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>——</p><p> </p><p>Kai'sa knocked on the door to Seraphine's apartment. She'd gotten lost the first few times she had been here, trying to find the right one, but she knew exactly which one it was by now.</p><p>The door was opened, and Kai'sa walked inside the room to the sight and sound of Seraphine bouncing around, singing along to her music. Her movements were loose and full of enthusiasm, the type of dancing that happens when no one else can see you. Kai'sa suppressed a giggle, watching Sera brush her hair out of her face every couple seconds.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "When the waves come crashing down </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stand up, don't fall and drown"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Seraphine was a remarkably good singer, and Kai'sa could sit there all day and listen to her. She'd tried to convince the girl to go further into it, but all that had come of that was a minor social media presence over summer break that had ended after university started back up for the year.</p><p><em> "There's nothing I want more" </em> Sera sang, and Kai'sa decided to join in singing on the next line, her singing voice a lot less trained than Sera's: <em> "But for you to catch me, by the shore" </em>.</p><p>When the lyrics stopped and the song played on, Seraphine suddenly ran over to Kai'sa and hugged her tightly, before sighing and sitting down on her couch.</p><p>"I forgot to take my ADHD meds today."</p><p>Seraphine sounded guilty, and Kai'sa had to stop herself from rushing back over to comfort her. This wasn't the first time this had happened, but it hadn't happened in a long while.</p><p>"I'm fine! Nothing bad has happened today. Don't worry about me at all." Sera insisted, clearly wanting not to expand on it further. Kai'sa's concern must have been showing on her face. She knew that nothing bad would come of this, but it didn't stop her from worrying.</p><p>Instead of lying, insisting that she wasn't worrying when she had been, Kai'sa changed the topic.</p><p>She put on a mock serious expression,  "You won't believe how awful my day was. The library was full, so I had to study in my <em> flat </em>." </p><p>Keeping a straight face for that had already been a struggle, and when her girlfriend started giggling, Kai’sa couldn’t hold it, and she started laughing as well.</p><p>"Poor you, it must have been impossible to study with Akali around" Seraphine managed to get out after they’d both stopped laughing. "Hopefully you managed to get some quiet time."</p><p>Smirking, Kai'sa replied. "Oh, Akali wasn't there. I saw her at the library." The shocked look on Sera's face made her continue onwards. "And she was with others, no less."</p><p>"Well, I guess I'm thankful for them getting her to leave you alone, then. It gives me more time with you." Seraphine smiled, and then her smile became more mischievous. "Bug Akali about them for me, won't you?"</p><p>After assuring her that she would, Kai'sa remembered why she was ostensibly here. "We should probably get started with making dinner soon, don't want to leave it too late." </p><p>Without waiting for a response, she got up off the couch in one clean movement, and strode towards the kitchen area, scanning for the promised ingredients, checking the cupboard and fridge in doing so. Sera groaned as she got up slowly and reluctantly, and started pointing out various ingredients she'd bought, her mouth talking faster than her hands could keep up. Eventually, after Kai'sa had gotten Sera to slow down a bit, they got to cooking.</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>They'd made a simple curry, not too spicy, and with a decent amount of vegetables. Kai'sa had led the cooking, as she had a far greater affinity for the activity then Seraphine did. Sera had needed to learn the basics after she moved to Uni, but she definitely didn't excel at it, and especially not when she was struggling to keep her hands still and her mind focused. (The meal had almost gone awry when she'd lost count of how many cups of water she'd put in the rice cooker; she'd been thinking about the fact that she was counting the number of cups she'd put in, and then forgotten that number.)</p><p>They'd thrown on the news as background noise. It was boring television, sure, but it didn't require any focus, and neither of them had bothered to check current events during the day.</p><p>Seraphine devoured the food, her appetite not being suppressed by her medications like it normally would be. The dish was tasty, leaving her disappointed that they hadn't made any more when she was done. </p><p>They'd used all the ingredients that Seraphine had bought. She just hadn't planned on not taking her medications when she bought the ingredients.</p><p> </p><p>"Kai?" Seraphine asked nervously, her fingers tapping the chair leg as she did.</p><p>"Hmm?" Kai'sa turned away from watching the news, her full focus shifted to her girlfriend.</p><p>"Thank you"</p><p>"What for?" Kai'sa's open face was one of confusion and care, and it helped Seraphine have the confidence to keep going.</p><p>"For…" She paused a second, trying to find the words. "For being here. Not just now, but everyday. Especially today."</p><p>Seraphine knew that one day off of medications wasn't going to be the end of the world. The other few times it'd happened since she started living away from her family had been rough for her mental health at the time though. This time that hadn't happened though; she had someone to keep her steady through the day.</p><p>"I'm always going to be here for you when you need it, I promise." Kai'sa responded, her steady tone leaving no doubt that she believed what she said.</p><p> </p><p>———</p><p> </p><p>Seraphine was getting tired. It was only 10pm, but she was very very tired. It had snuck up on her slowly, disguising itself under the guise of thoughts not coming together cleanly. There was no way she was going to stay awake for another hour.</p><p>It wasn't helped by the fact that Kai'sa lap was <em> very </em> comfortable. She'd fall asleep on it at this rate. "Kaiii." Seraphine murmured.</p><p>The other girl didn't stop running her hands through Sera's long hair (that <em> definitely </em> wasn't helping with the sleepiness) as she whispered back. </p><p>"Babe?"</p><p>"I'm getting tired."</p><p>"Do you want me to stay overnight? Akali won't worry about me."</p><p>"Don't worry abou… zzzz"</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry abou… zzzz"</p><p>Kai'sa had to bite back a laugh as her girlfriend fell asleep mid sentence, snoring quietly on her lap. She sat still, just smiling at the sight for a couple minutes, before she decided to start getting ready to head home. She had to catch a bus back to her flat, and she would miss the last one if she wasn't quick.</p><p>Getting up from where she was wasn't a trivial thing. Thankfully Seraphine was a deep sleeper, and didn't do more than make mumbling noises as Kai'sa carried her carefully to her bed, before tucking her under her blankets with a soft kiss to her forehead.</p><p> </p><p>Kai'sa got home safely. Akali was still awake, gaming. Kai'sa decided to hold off on bugging Akali about the people she was studying with for now. She'd do it at some point, Sera had asked her to. But not tonight. Kai'sa got ready for bed herself instead.</p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Seraphine woke up to find herself tucked neatly under the covers of her bed, still in her clothes from yesterday.</p><p>It was a Saturday morning; she could afford to sleep in a bit, enjoying the soft blankets around her. Eventually though, she did have to get up, and when she did, she made sure the first thing she did was take her medications. </p>

          <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I guess this is my first fic. (Well, apart from the Lord of the Flies one we had to write for year 10 English. That doesn't count.)</p><p>Before I do anything else, I want to address ADHD and medications and all that:<br/>- If you choose not to or are unable to take ADHD medications, you are valid. Everyone should do what is best for them, and I will never judge anyone for doing so.<br/>- Forgetting to take ADHD meds for a day really is not that bad. The first day you still have some focus. What does happen for me though is that at around 8pm, I will get super emotional. That experience is what I tried to capture with Sera saying "Thank you". It's less "this is awful" and more "she is super emotional rn".</p><p>Now that that's done, onto me rambling about other stuff:</p><p>- The song that's playing when Kai'sa walks into Sera's apartment is MYLK - Mermaid. It's a great song, and I felt it really fit Sera's personality.<br/>- If Seraphine did a STEM subject she'd totally do maths. It's super abstract, it's super pretty, and it flows in a way other STEM stuff doesn't. (However, I am aware that every single maths student has at least one character that they'd make this argument for. It's just how we are.)<br/>This took me like 3 weeks of working on it for maybe 30 minutes a day (used it to relax after studying). I was aiming for around 2k words when I started, and it just turned into 5k and I'm happy with that. Never going to even let the thought of being annoyed at another work's update schedule cross my mind again though lol.</p><p> </p><p>Editing the A/N months later, because I realised I forgot something: you should go read Swordjaw's <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/29915265" rel="nofollow">In bocca al lupo</a>. Reading it was what led to me writing this, and hence led to me writing fic at all. It's real good.</p></blockquote>
