<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Caitlyn was on her ninth cup of black tea for the day, and was far past her chance to stop at a healthy amount. She knew it wasn’t a good idea. Addictions rarely are. That had never stopped her before, and it wasn't going to now. At least it was far cheaper than coffee. </p><p>It had been a stressful day. She had made the trip to where she would be living for the next four years of her life (or longer, if things went poorly). It was her first time in Zaun, and her first time living away from her family's Piltover home. She was exhausted. The drive here had been three hours long, and she had had nothing to do but doubt herself. It had not been a pleasant experience.</p><p>The silver lining of this cloud of a day had been finding out that her apartment was nicer than it had looked online. It was a fifteen minute cycle away from campus, and she wasn’t going to have to share the space with anyone. It had a large bedroom, a desk with lots of space (although Cailtyn suspected it wouldn't be enough), a kitchen with all the things she'd need and more, and a smooth wooden table to sit at and stare at the TV. It was a very good apartment. Her parents had made sure of that.</p><p>The thought of her parents brought her mood back down. She had promised to give them a call when she arrived in Zaun, and she couldn't delay it any longer without worrying them.</p><p>After gulping down the rest of her tea in one go (the burn was part of the experience). Caitlyn called her mother. The conversation was brief and stilted, never giving her a chance to say more than a "yep" or "mhm" before she was cut off. In one exceptionally long pause she even managed to fit in an entire "understood". Her mother had figured out at least twenty different ways to say "if you ever want to come back, just let us know.", and each one was more patronising than the last. Her mother cared about her, Caitlyn knew that. She just only cared for her when it was good for the family’s public image. Caitlyn had never felt more sure of her decision to come to Zaun University than during that call.</p><p>If anyone asked, she would tell them that the decision to move here had been for strictly academic reasons. The criminal law courses in Zaun were world famous and the ones in Piltover were a disgrace. Annoying her mother had just been a free gift thrown in. </p><p>Moving to lie down on the large couch in front of the TV (the apartment was <em> nice </em>), she flipped through channels in an attempt to distract her mind. A reality show (she had Thoughts about the whole industry). A panel show (the people on it had yet to realise that sex jokes weren't inherently funny). A murder mystery show (as much as she loved watching them, she wasn't in the mood to feel old tonight). A football match (she had never bothered to learn to tell the different types apart). In the end, Caitlyn went with the boring option: the evening news.</p><p>There was nothing happening in the world. No new wars, no natural disaster, no politician saying something so stupid that their parents really should have been called to pick them up. It was comforting. Her day hadn't been the best, but at least the rest of the world wasn't doing any worse. </p><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>

<li><em>Find a store that runs Turmoil events</em></li>
</ul><p> </p><p>—————</p><p> </p><p>Caitlyn had one thing left to mark off of her to-do list. The week had been spent slowly working her way through the list, using a ruler to perfectly cross through each item as she completed it. She had started using physical lists to motivate her as a young kid, and there was no reason for her to stop while they still worked. Digital ones didn't have the same satisfaction of viciously crossing off a challenging task that she could get with a paper one. More than one pencil had been broken in the exaltation of finishing a particularly difficult goal.</p><p>This was why she was now standing in front of a large store in the outskirts of Zaun, an hour away from her apartment, wondering if she should have ignored the negative reviews online about the store closer to her apartment. This one didn't look impressive at all from the outside, a neon sign with faded shine proclaiming the name of the shop as "The Last Drop", a sun-bleached pool-table-green band winding around the top of the store. It was definitely the place she was looking for.</p><p><em> "You going inside any time soon?" </em> a frustrated voice said from behind her, knocking her out of her thoughts. Turning, she saw a girl with red hair looking as though she was fed up with the world, her hands covered by wraps and her clothes worn as though she was fed up with them as well.</p><p>Caitlyn could move aside, head home, go to the other store the next week. University wouldn't start until after then, so she had the time. If this was what all the people who played here were like, maybe she should do that.</p><p><em> "I’d like to get inside before it starts, so it’d be nice if you could make up your mind." </em> the other girl said, more frustrated and much more clearly directed at Caitlyn this time.</p><p>Leaving would be a waste though. She'd made the trip out here, and losing two hours of her life for nothing wasn't a particularly warm concept. Besides, she wanted to play <em> Turmoil </em> in person, and this was her only chance for the next week.</p><p>She committed to her choice and pushed the door of the shop open, a robotic chime playing as she stepped through the door frame. She held the door open for the girl behind her without even thinking about it. A hiss of "I can open a door by myself" made her regret that instinct. What kind of a person would complain about someone <em> holding the door open for them </em>? It was hard to remain frustrated at something that was just so baffling. She could have spent hours chasing that question in her mind, finding all the threads of it and picking them apart.</p><p>She didn’t get a chance to do so, her thoughts disrupted when a booming voice announced that it was the last chance to sign up for the event. She hurried over to the line, finding herself the last person in it. A minute later she was at the front and stepped up to the counter. "Caitlyn" she declared before he could start talking, hoping she wouldn't have to give her last name.</p><p>Her last name (or lack thereof) didn’t come up, but the man did ("Vander" his name tag said) offer a "Haven't seen you here before." as he entered her into the bracket for the event, which she just nodded in response to.</p><p>She made her way to an empty seat on the other side of the room, a table no one else was sitting on.</p><p>As the list of names scrolled up the monitors attached to the wall in a hideous bright green on black that looked like it was from a movie, Caitlyn spotted her name as it rose by. Confident that she wouldn’t get forgotten, she took the opportunity to take her deck out from where she had set her bag down.</p><p>Her hands started idly shuffling the cards, the motions so ingrained in them from years of playing the game. How long had it been since she had last played <em> Turmoil </em>? There had been year 12 exams to study for, and then her family had gone on their yearly Christmas holiday to the beach, and then she'd been preparing to move to Zaun, and then…</p><p>It had been at least six months. She'd spent months forgoing her favourite hobby. It wasn't like she had forgotten about it the whole time; she'd been following the spoilers for the new sets online and theorising ways to use the new cards. She'd even kept up with her guilty pleasure of arguing with people who thought <em> Gluttonous Book </em> was a bad card online! But somehow in all that she had never once sat down across from someone else, shuffled up her deck, and played a game. She was going to be <em> so </em> out of practice.</p><p> </p><p>The booming voice (Vander, she reminded herself) called out, announcing that pairings for round one were up. Caitlyn was playing on table 16 this round, up against a "Ben". No one else had a listed last name either, she realised while watching the pairings scroll by.</p><p>The table numbers were ordered in a snake from the front of the room to the back, and so she didn't have to move far to get to her spot. Ben had short blonde hair in a fringe and didn't say much as he sat down other than to confirm that she was Caitlyn. </p><p>She guessed that the die roll would be an even number. She always did. It rolled a 19. Hmph. Ben chose to go first, and they shuffled up their decks, offered to let the other cut them (Caitlyn always took this opportunity. Jayce had shown her how easy it was to cheat when she was 14), and then drew their opening six cards.</p><p>Her hand was amazing. It was the kind of hand that played itself. So was her opponent’s, in the opposite way. He didn't get to attack a single time in the game, her control deck countering almost every one of his spells, and the ones that she couldn't counter, she destroyed immediately. In the end, he conceded before she had to get around to the formality of actually winning. Maybe she shouldn’t have worried so much about how rusty she would be. Sure, that was <em> literally </em> the perfect draw, but she'd played it well even still. </p><p>Game two was closer. Her opening hand was mediocre, and he'd been able to take the deadweight cards out of his deck in between games. Still, he was playing a midrange deck, and her deck specialised in these matchups. She survived the early game, and after she had enough of an advantage, she cast her copy of <em> Voidspawn </em> and attacked with it three times for the win. That game felt good. She was in control, she was thinking sharp (like a razor, her mother always said. It was usually said after Caitlyn had been caught getting in trouble, but that wasn’t important right now), and she was making the right decisions. She was having fun.</p><p>They both said their "good games" to each other and packed up their cards. After going to the counter to report her win, she’d made her way to the seat at the back of the room, and took a moment to survey the room. It was a diverse group of people, one boy with very spiky red and green hair (she was tempted to ask him how he got his hair to stay like that), another with flowing brown hair, and another with bright white hair.</p><p>And there was the red-haired girl from earlier, sitting and chatting with a younger girl who had blue hair. They both looked happy, so they'd probably both won their first round. Caitlyn was much more likely to play the red-haired girl if they'd both won their first round. She didn't know if that would be a good or a bad thing. It would be satisfying to win, but her deck didn’t make her any friends. She was also just the slightest worried that the girl would find her afterwards, and shove her in a trash can or something. She looked like the kind of person to do that. It was a silly worry, but rationality wasn’t a strong point of fear.</p><p>She caught herself getting caught in her thoughts and put her head down, not wanting to seem like she was staring at the girl. Her thoughts wouldn't give her a chance to catch herself once they got going, and being caught would've been incredibly embarrassing.</p><p>Round two pairings went up (that green-on-black colour scheme was giving her a headache), and Caitlyn was playing on table 8, playing against a "Poppy". </p><p>Poppy wasn’t someone she had noticed earlier, shorter than most people in the store. She had already been set up at the table when Caitlyn found it. She was more talkative than Ben had been (although that wasn't saying much), and they chatted about nothing while shuffling up and preparing to start the game. Caitlyn won the die roll and chose to go first, and they played. And played. And played.</p><p>The first game was an endurance feat. Poppy was playing an explore tempo deck and took the initiative early in the game. She had baited out Caitlyn's energy for the turn into countering her smaller minion and then played her bigger minion the same turn when Caitlyn couldn't do anything about it. She'd tried her best for the rest of the game to survive, but Poppy's spells always kept her exactly one step ahead until eventually, after a gruelling 40-minute game, she was able to deal the last point of damage to Caitlyn’s life points and win. </p><p>Caitlyn was happier than she had been in months. She hadn't played a game that good in years. It had been a joy, trading spells back and forth, each asking questions with their cards that demanded an answer from the other. Poppy looked to have enjoyed it as well, and they made more idle chatter while moving their side cards for game two into their decks.</p><p>Every silver lining had a cloud, however. The cloud here was that Caitlyn was down a game, and had only 15 minutes left to win another game. Even if she managed to do that, she would have to get ahead in the third game when time ran out. She'd switched in extra copies of <em> Voidspawn </em> to have a better chance, but even with them, her deck was slow. Long games had always favoured her in the past, her deck being one of the strongest in games that went this long. She had never had to play against the clock from behind with it.</p><p>Game 2 was over in ten minutes. Poppy had drawn only energy cards, and could never get the initiative before Caitlyn's deck took over. An early <em> Voidspawn </em> draw helped her seal the deal. By some stroke of luck, she had a chance. Not much of one, but she had one.</p><p>If there hadn’t been a time limit, the third game would have been close. Poppy had snuck some small minions through, Caitlyn had destroyed them, and they'd done that dance a few more times, Poppy always on the front foot but never enough to squeeze a game-winning advantage out of it.</p><p>The game was decided by a single point of life that Caitlyn had gained. One of her counterspells had gained it, and when time ran out, and then the five turns after that, Poppy hadn’t managed to get a hit in. It was a silly way to win, and she didn’t feel proud of it, but the rules said she won.</p><p>They had drawn quite a crowd, being the last game to finish. Vander had asked them the result after it was done and then trod back to the computer to enter it into the software. As soon as he had, the crowd, previously respectfully quiet, burst into conversation, no longer interested in the game. Poppy looked dispirited but held out her hand and they shook with a "good game". </p><p>There was a five-minute break between the rounds, which Caitlyn used to take a drink of tea from her thermos. It was still boiling hot, but the pain would help her focus until the caffeine kicked in. Her body was getting better at healing faster, realising it wasn’t going to win this fight.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She was on table 1 for the third and final round. It didn't mean she was playing for first place (at least 5 people would tie for first she estimated after a glance around the room), but it did make the table easy to find right at the front of the store. </p><p>Oh. Her opponent was the blue-haired girl who'd been talking to the red-haired girl earlier. This was only slightly better than if she'd played against the other one herself. The girl introduced herself as Powder and then didn’t say anything more. Powder was struggling to stay still in her seat, Caitlyn noticed, her body shifting from side to side often.</p><p>Caitlyn’s hand was full of good cards. They could answer anything the other girl played, except for a few specific cards that weren’t commonly played. The first few turns had no cards played, which was odd. Almost no one else played a deck similar to hers, and every other deck wanted to try to make an early play. Even odder was when Powder played <em> Line Chain </em> on turn 4, a random common from four years ago, worth less than the cardboard it was printed on. It was no threat, and so she let it stay around, spending her energy on drawing cards instead. Powder played <em> Alert! Kookaburra </em> and <em> No More </em> on her next two turns, two more worthless cards.</p><p>Clearly, Powder had some kind of plan. She had won both of her matches so far, and assuming that the girl had just been lucky would be unfair. So, she killed the <em> Kookaburra </em>. If it turned out to be nothing, she would be able to win even after doing that. If it was something, hopefully she had just stopped it. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>She found out what it was on the next turn. Powder played <em> Comet Wyrm </em>, which was yet another common, and then unexpectedly, held out her hand. When Caitlyn didn’t react, Powder quietly asked "gg?". Caitlyn couldn’t figure out what was happening. Was the girl conceding? What was going on? After she didn’t respond for another few seconds, Powder started explaining,  pointing at cards rapidly, tapping back and forth, searching her deck at least fifteen times, moving a card from one zone to another, only to immediately move the card back to where it started.</p><p>The explanation took five minutes, and at the end of it Powder won through a combination of three cards that hadn't even been in her hand at the start of the turn. No wonder Caitlyn hadn't seen this coming. How could she have? No one played combo decks like this back in Piltover, and especially not with bulk cards as a core. She knew what was going on now, and she still had two more games she could win. Surprise only works once, after all.</p><p>Caitlyn resolved to update that phrase to "Surprise only works twice" after game two. She had gotten caught off guard <em> again </em>, and lost to the same combo/ The cards it had started with this time were completely different to the last game though. Powder must have built this deck herself. Caitlyn had never seen anything like it. It was a masterpiece. It was moderately frustrating to lose to, sure. But it wasn’t like Caitlyn’s deck was any less frustrating for her opponents.</p><p>The two booster packs she had won as a prize had nothing valuable in them. The odds were always against anything good being in them, the rarest cards being in less than one in every thousand booster packs. They were beautiful though, a gold sheen covering the frame, the glimmer card art taking up the entire space. She had a full max rarity version of her deck back home that she had bought with entirely her own money, the result of years of saving. It had been worth at least $2000 when she had last checked.</p><p> </p><p>It was 9 pm by the time the event ended, and with an hour drive back to her apartment, the sky would be pitch black by the time she got there if she waited any longer to leave. There was only one small issue. The doorway was blocked by the red-haired girl. She had been standing there for the last few minutes and didn't look like she was going to move any time soon.</p><p>It gave her a perfect opportunity to get some of her dignity back from earlier. Consolidating her confidence (she had to look confident for this to work), she slowly stepped up to the door and asked <em> "You going outside anytime soon?" </em> in a tone of barely held back frustration.</p><p>It was <em> very </em> satisfying to see the other girl react in surprise, and the glare she was giving her was just <em> perfect </em>. Caitlyn had a lot of experience with being glared at. This one wasn't even particularly scary. It was almost cute.</p><p>The girl still didn't move though.</p><p>
  <em> "I'd quite like to get home before it's pitch black out, so if you could make a decision I'd greatly appreciate it." </em>
</p><p>Slightly more proper than what the other girl had said earlier, but no one could ever accuse Caitlyn of not being proper when she wanted to be. The other girl finally opened the door and went outside, not dropping the glare until she was firmly outside.</p><p>Caitlyn didn't miss how she didn't hold the door open behind her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Caitlyn had signed up for every activity she could during Zaun University’s orientation week. Making connections would help get her off to a good start. She didn't know anyone here, and she hoped that no one would know who she was. It was a fresh start, of sorts.</p><p>She hadn’t thought about how much work it would be. Talking to people, doing quizzes, and jogging between events to get to the next one on time. She’d done enough exercise for a month already, and it was only Thursday morning. Caitlyn was an introvert. Her social battery had run out of juice on Tuesday. Only her years of practice creating a mask, for use at social events her mother would drag her to, kept her going. Caitlyn’s mouth was on autopilot and her brain was focused on remembering names.</p><p>She was currently in the middle of a quiz being run by the university's chess club. None of the questions so far had been about chess. Just like the other quizzes Caitlyn had done this week, it had questions about the campus, questions about the people who ran the chess club, and questions about everything except for chess. What was the point of a quiz about everything other than the reason people were there?</p><p>She knew the answers to most of the questions about campus already from other quizzes ("What is the closest coffee shop to campus?" had been the first question on all of them. Universities were addicted to coffee), and using the internet to find out very specific details about people very quickly was something she had a lot of experience in (she didn’t have much else to do as a teenager). After the third round of questions, Caitlyn was in the lead.</p><p>For the fourth round, they were assigned pairs. It seemed a bit late in the quiz to do so (how were they going to make sure it was fair?), but Caitlyn wasn’t going to make a fuss about it. Her partner introduced himself as Ekko. Something about his bright white hair tickled at the back of her mind, as though she had seen him before. He was smart, and they breezed through the questions in the fourth round, the pair staying in first place.</p><p>The fifth round of questions were, surprisingly enough, actually about Chess. Caitlyn had been banking on this not happening. She had frozen up during the first question, and Ekko had tapped her on the shoulder to try to get her attention. She’d had to awkwardly admit that she hadn't played Chess much since she was in primary school, six years ago. She still knew the rules and had played a few online games over the years, but none in person.</p><p>By the end of the round, some of her chess knowledge had come back to her, previously submerged in the depths of her memory. She’d even answered the last question. The two of them ended up winning by a large margin. The prize was a black hoodie with the chess club's logo across the front of it in white. It looked comfortable, and she would probably wear it around during winter. Caitlyn had always appreciated that about the nerdier clubs: they didn't even try to look good, and so they were always the most comfortable. No club had ever made a good looking piece of merch, and the ones that tried to look stylish just ended up being both ugly and uncomfortable.</p><p><br/>
The most popular coffee shop on campus was called "<em>The Coffee Shop</em>". It wasn't a creative name, trying to sound clever but failing to be clever. Caitlyn didn't drink coffee, so she had chosen from their baked goods selection. She was currently eating her way through a vanilla cupcake, which had been absolutely coated in icing. Any more icing and it would be more icing than cake, she’d thought.</p><p>She was browsing through the spoilers for the newest <em>Turmoil</em> set on her phone. In recent years they had started revealing more of the new sets before they came out, and she would miss cards if she wasn’t on top of it. She wasn't sure how she felt about the new set, <em>Edge of the Woods</em>. It had a fairytale-inspired theme, something new for the game. The cards were all very powerful, though. The community was worried that there would be too much power creep, and force people to buy the new cards to stay competitive. </p><p>The art in the set was cute, featuring faeries, beasts and even a few definitely-not-corgis. There were even a few cards Caitlyn wanted to try out in her deck, which was fairly rare in newer sets. </p><p>Her alarm went off silently, telling her that it was time to get going for her next event that she had committed to doing, an introduction for a group that was meant to “replicate the feeling of living on-campus for those living off-campus”. It wasn't something she planned to participate in much, but the other activity in this time slot had been a gym event and that was something she would participate in even less.</p><p>She quickly finished off the rest of her cupcake, and stood up to leave. She would have to come back here sometime, it had been a good cupcake. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a very specific shade of red. It couldn’t be her, could it? That would be just Caitlyn's luck. She didn't have the energy to navigate that conversation right now.</p><p>Very specifically looking anywhere except for that direction, she briskly walked outside. As she walked past the glass windows of the coffee shop, on her way to the next thing, she glanced inside to try to put her worries at rest. They were not put to rest. It was the girl. Thankfully, she didn't look like she'd noticed Caitlyn yet. Hopefully, she wouldn’t notice her at all. She could deal with this later, she told herself, as she looked forwards again.</p><p>Caitlyn didn't see the girl again for the rest of the week, even when she went to the same shop the next morning. She’d tried the chocolate cupcake this time. It was worse than the vanilla one.</p><p>—————</p><p>Despite being more exhausted after this week than she had been after the week before (somehow), Caitlyn had no doubts about going to locals. It would be fun, and she needed some fun after the brimstone she'd put herself through all week. Keeping a mask up for eight hours a day, five days a week was not something she wanted to ever do again. The hour it took to drive to The Last Drop was the first hour Caitlyn had had to herself all week, and she let her brain relax during it.</p><p>She arrived fifteen minutes before the event started, giving her time to find a seat and relax for a bit after she had signed up for the event. The room was cold compared to the summer heat outside, and Caitlyn wished she had brought a jacket with her.</p><p>This briefly acquired peace of mind was shattered when Powder walked through the door, followed closely by the red-haired girl. How was Powder allowed to hold the door open for her, but Caitlyn got hissed at for doing it?</p><p>Hopes weren’t enough to stop the girl from seeing Caitlyn in her scan of the room, and when their eyes locked for a second, the girl just glared at her. Caitlyn broke the eye contact after a couple of seconds, putting her head down. Why couldn't the girl just ignore her? It was what everyone else who had a grudge against her did. Powder seemed to have not noticed the other girl stopping in place for a second, and had continued moving to a table on the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Her first round match took a long time, but Caitlyn never had any doubt that she would end up winning. Her opponent was playing a ramp deck, which tried to get lots of energy very quickly and then played huge minions before Caitlyn could deal with them. The way to win against them was to stop the ramp cards, and then get far enough ahead before any of the expensive cards came out that they didn’t matter. It was a matchup she had played many times before, back in Piltover; ramp was one of the most popular decks, especially for more casual players. People really enjoyed playing big things.</p><p>Her opponent didn't cope particularly well with not getting to “play the game”, and in game two they made misplays due to the tilt. After Caitlyn had won, they'd stomped away without even offering a "good game".</p><p> </p><p>The pairings, displayed in the green on black colour scheme that was not growing on Caitlyn at all, had gone up for the second round. Three minutes after Caitlyn sat down at the assigned table, her opponent still hadn't shown up. She was frustrated. If her opponent didn't show up in the next two minutes they would automatically forfeit the round. She'd take the win, but she would much rather play the game. Finding something to do for the next hour wouldn't be fun.</p><p>There was one minute left for her opponent to show up. Then there were thirty seconds. Then fifteen. Then ten. According to her phone's clock, there had been seven seconds left before she would win when a not-very-quiet thud came from across the table. Her opponent had decided to show up, cutting it near as close as possible. They'd probably have an excuse, she thought as she looked up, and she would accept it and mov-- Oh. She wasn't getting an excuse. Across from her sat the red-haired girl (Violet, she recalled the pairings had said her name was), and if the expression on her face was anything to go by, she felt exactly as unhappy about this as Caitlyn did.</p><p>"<em>You're</em> Violet?"</p><p>If only the other girl had taken seven seconds longer to sit down. Caitlyn would have happily claimed the win if the girl had shown up even a second late. She couldn’t have made this any worse than it already would be by doing so.</p><p>"It's Vi.", Vi forced out. “If we both shut up and get this done with, we can play it out and then never talk again."</p><p>Caitlyn agreed with the sentiment, although she didn't voice it. She would quite like to get these games done as fast as possible. Vi won the die roll and chose to go first. On the first turn of the game, she played an energy card and then cast <em>Temple Guide</em>, a minion with high power that could attack straight away, traits that made it popular in aggressive decks. Vi immediately attacked with the <em>Guide</em> and Caitlyn couldn’t do anything about it, taking the damage. Caitlyn would be on the back foot in this matchup, playing to survive, every life point mattering. The deck fit Vi perfectly. It was aggressive, angry, and would usually win right before it ran out of time. (Caitlyn was still annoyed at her for showing up so late).</p><p>On Vi’s third turn, the girl broke the antagonistic silence between the two of them. "<em>Could you stop fucking doing that?</em>". It was almost a shout, the people playing on nearby tables turning to look at them before quickly turning away.</p><p>Caitlyn had no clue what the girl was talking about, responding with "Could I stop doing what?". She wasn't tapping the table, she wasn't fiddling with anything, she had made sure to not flick her cards this game.</p><p>"Every time I do anything at all, you stop, tilt your head sideways slightly, go "<em>hmm"</em>, and then after five seconds you just say it's fine. Every damn time I do anything. It's getting on my nerves." Vi said. Her voice was more controlled this time, but it was still full of frustration. </p><p>Caitlyn hadn’t realised she was doing that. She stopped to think whenever her opponent did everything, yes. If she never pretended to consider things even if she wasn't actually considering them, the opponent would always know when she had a way to stop their thing in her hand. Bluffing was an important skill in her deck.</p><p>The head tilt and the "<em>hmm</em>" however? Those she hadn't known she did.</p><p>It would be less trouble to not argue over this point, and so Caitlyn had simply said “Sure”. Vi nodded at that.</p><p><br/>
Caitlyn lost the first game in the match and then won the second, tying the score at 1-1. In the first game, she hadn't been able to stabilise before Vi could run her over with her cheap minions. In the second game, a well-timed board wipe had given her the edge, halting Vi’s assault and stabilising from there. They had managed to figure out how to communicate entirely without words, only using gestures and pointing cards aggressively at other cards. She could only imagine how funny it would look to anyone watching, both of them refusing to talk to each other with words.</p><p>After game two, Caitlyn noticed that Powder had come over and was watching their game from behind Vi. The blue-haired girl looked happy, so she'd probably won her match. That, or she was enjoying watching Caitlyn and Vi act like disgruntled teenagers. (Caitlyn was still technically a teenager, but that wasn’t the point)</p><p>It was likely a combination of both. When Vi did a hand gesture involving aggressively pointing at herself to indicate that she was going first, Powder was unable to restrain a giggle. Caitlyn and Vi had both immediately turned to stare at her, and the tense atmosphere between the two of them broke slightly. Powder had a point, Caitlyn was forced to admit to herself. They were both being very silly by doing this. It was immature and a waste of their time. </p><p>When Caitlyn played <em>Abolish</em> to stop Vi’s first minion in this game, she did it the same way she usually would in other matches, instead of with gestures. "Abolish the <em>Companion</em>?". It was only a half-surprise to hear the other girl mutter out "I guess" in response. The game continued to play out with them communicating like it was a normal game, although the hand gestures were still there. </p><p>The game was coming to a close, Caitlyn struggling for answers and not finding any. She’d eventually had to resort to playing <em>Voidspawn</em> as a last-ditch attempt to kill Vi before Vi killed her. The exhaustion of the week had set in, and Caitlyn knew she wasn't going to be able to win. Vi played a minion that buffed her team, and moved to combat. She had lethal damage, and Caitlyn was getting ready to politely accept defeat, and get away before anything else happened.</p><p>Vi ended her turn without attacking. Was she trying to play around something? Caitlyn had no energy available, so she couldn't be. Was she trying to rub the victory in? That didn't make sense either, because Caitlyn could win this turn by attacking with <em>Voidspawn</em>. Vi had lost a game she should have won. Caitlyn ran through all the possibilities in her mind, trying to figure out if she had missed a line on her side that would stop lethal.</p><p>"Just win already, no need to rub it in." came Vi's voice. The girl sounded tired. There wasn't any good reason for not attacking. Vi had miscalculated the damage she could deal.</p><p>The right play here was to attack, win, and never mention the misplay. She could win, walk away from this, and move on to the next round. It wouldn't feel good though. There wouldn't be any sense of pride in it, a hollow victory. She had learnt that those never felt good at a young age.</p><p>If Caitlyn never had to interact with Vi again, she would be happier for it. The two of them had gotten off to a bad start, and neither of them wanted to try to fix it. She'd concede if it was a friend of hers sitting on the other side of the table, though, and that meant that she should do that for everyone if she didn’t have a good reason not to. Disliking the other player wasn’t a good reason. Losing to an obvious mistake due to exhaustion was one of the most miserable feelings ever. </p><p>Caitlyn had made her choice, and she started packing up her cards.</p><p>"Not even going to give me the respect of attacking?". Vi's voice sounded dead.</p><p>Caitlyn's head shot up. She hadn't even considered that it might look like she was being rude, and assuming her win before the game was over.</p><p>"I'm conceding. You missed an obvious win and I don't want to win this way. Purely a selfish decision." She answered. It was a selfish decision. She didn't want to feel guilty over the hollow victory. She wasn't doing this for Vi's feelings.</p><p>"I'm one damage off. 3+2+5=10, you have 11 health." Vi hadn’t noticed her miscalculation yet.</p><p>"The <em>Knight</em> buffs itself as well, so it's actually eleven damage" </p><p>Caitlyn was exhausted. She just wanted to move on to the next round, play it out, and then go home and sleep. She didn't have the energy for navigating this conversation, and she would just anger the other girl if she tried to continue it.</p><p>Vi didn't seem interested in continuing the conversation either, muttering "huh", before she packed up her cards and went to report the score. Caitlyn slid back into her chair. She'd move when the next round was called, but right now she didn't want to have to use the energy to get up out of her chair. </p><p><br/>
In the third round, Caitlyn played against a girl who was playing a reanimator deck. The deck wanted to get a big minion into the graveyard, and then revive it with a card that was much cheaper than it would cost to play the minion it was reviving. It was similar to a combo deck, and some people even considered it a type of combo deck. This particular build didn't even seem to be playing the right energy to play its big minions normally if the game went long, which meant it was unarguably a combo deck.</p><p>The first game went poorly. Her opponent got an <em>Invoked Demon</em> back on turn four and then proceeded to draw fourteen cards and attack for half of Caitlyn's life. She wasn't coming back from that, so she conceded. She had graveyard hate in her sideboard for matchups against decks that relied on their graveyard, which would give her more ways to stop the combo before it happened.</p><p>Game two was easy. Caitlyn shuffled their target back into their deck from the graveyard, and they didn't have a way to get another minion into their graveyard until Caitlyn had a lot of resources and could stop it easily. Drawing only one half of a combo was always a risk when playing a deck that needed two halves. It was why Caitlyn had never enjoyed playing them. Game three went similarly. They drew only targets and none of the reanimation spells, and couldn't do anything until it was too late. It was as though all their big minions were apologising for not showing up in game two all at once.</p><p><br/>
After shaking her opponent's hand, Caitlyn stood up, reported her result, and prepared to leave. She didn’t want to drive any more tired than she already was. Getting in an accident would ruin all her plans for university.</p><p>Powder seemed to have gone 3-0 again, judging by the pile of boosters the girl was holding. It didn't surprise Caitlyn. The girl's deck was incredibly powerful, and wouldn't be easy for anyone to beat.</p><p>Vi was blocking the door again. Caitlyn had really hoped to avoid another conversation with the girl today, but it seemed like she would have to have one.</p><p>Thankfully, she didn’t have to get the girl’s attention. Vi had opened the door and slipped outside just as Caitlyn was preparing to ask her to move.</p><p>—————</p><p>Later, while Caitlyn was lying down trying to sleep, she realised that Vi had held the door open behind her as she’d left earlier.</p>
